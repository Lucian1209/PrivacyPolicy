        <h1>PrivacyPolicy</h1>
        <p>Developer built the "UFO Rush" app as an Ad Supported app. This

        This privacy policy is used to inform you regarding policies with the collection, use, and 
        disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use this Service.</p>
        <h3>1. Overview</h3>
        <p>The app uses advertising to make revenue. The app uses third party
        libraries for advertising which may collect and share personal information with third
        parties.</p>
            
        <p>Links to privacy policies of third party service providers used in the app</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy">Unity</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Sharing Your Information</h3>
        <p>
         The developer will share personal information with third parties only in the ways that are 
        described in this privacy statement.</p>
        <p>    
        Your personal information may be disclosed:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process.</li>
            <li>To any other third party with your prior consent to do so.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3. What information are collected and why</h3>

        <h3>3.1 Unity Analytics</h3>

        <p>Unity has collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers,
            as well as events completed or actions taken within the game, including level,
            number of credits, time it took you to earn them, metadata about in-game communications 
            and the value and details of purchases. Using our systems, the developer of the game
            has ongoing access to this data. This collection and use of data makes it possible 
            for your experience to operate as expected by permitting you to do things like 
            redeem rewards you have earned or return to where you left off in a game. 
            Other Unity customers may have access to aggregated reports about game activity 
            in general across a number of games. 
            These reports are based, in part, on your game activities, but do not specifically identify
            you or your device. The reports described in this paragraph help developers make decisions on 
            optimal methods to run the games they have made for you. For example, the developer may need 
            to know the types of devices running the game to determine how to support game updates 
            on an ongoing basis. Some data collected by Unity Analytics may be used by Unity Ads for 
            personalized advertising; see the FAQs related to advertising for more information.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Unity Ads</h3>

        <p>Unity Ads has probably collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, 
            and information regarding the delivery of ads and your interaction with them, all of which 
            may be shared with ad publishers and attribution companies. For clarity, Unity collects the 
            following data: whether you click or tap an ad for a new game, whether you watch the ad or 
            play a game frequently, whether others playing a game like the one you’re playing have 
            downloaded a particular new game, and whether you download and install the new game 
            you see advertised. All of this is for purposes of predicting the types of new games that 
            you might like to download. Unity may track additional data about you in the future for 
            purposes of making these types of predictions, and we will notify you prior to new data 
            collection.</p>

        <h3>4. Security</h3>

        <P>I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting your Personal
            Information. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of 
            electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute
            security.</P>

        <h3>5. Links to Other Sites</h3>

        <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you 
            will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me.
            Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have 
            no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or 
            practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

        <h3>6. Children’s Privacy</h3>

        <p> These Services do not address anyone under the age of 16. I do not knowingly collect 
            personally identifiable information from children under 16. In the case I discover that 
            a child under 16 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete those 
            informations. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has
            provided personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary
            actions.</p>

        <h3>7. Distribution</h3>

        <p>The only official channel for distribution of this app are:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/">Google Play Store</a></li>
            </ul>
            Any other mode of distribution is not official and thus, is not maintained by the developer.
            This privacy policy is effective to distribution made on official channel only.</p>
